## Hello, I'm Dan!

I'm just a guy from the United Kingdom currently delivering value as a Senior Software Engineer in the insurance industry using the dotnet ecosystem. I call myself a self-taught developer, but I don't think that's true anymore. I learn just as much from other people as I do from my own self-directed learning. In that sense, I might now consider it hubris to identify as a self-taught developer - but anyway, that's how I started off. Over a decade later I am still going strong, and I think that is testament to my passion for coding.

But it's not all sunshine and roses, and there are some very real problems I am encountering in life, which I write about in this blog. My hope is that through writing I can organise my thoughts and draw conclusions about the various topics I write about, such as health and productivity. It is a selfish endeavour really, but one that might enable some of my audience to feel like they are not alone.
